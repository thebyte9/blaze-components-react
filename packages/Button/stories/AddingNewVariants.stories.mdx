# Adding a New Component Variant

Variants are dynamically added by developers to a theme object.

In case we would like to add a new Call to Action Button. Components such as Modal are grouped as a stack of components while simple components such as Button requires just a wrapper or container definition.

While theming follows same React Composition principles as you'd normally follow while developing a custom component, e.g. a Modal is composed by other components such as header, body, accept/cancel buttons, close button, and so on... You will group the components inside the Theme object like in the following example,

```js

export const preset: ThemeType = {
  button: {
    variants: {
      default: {
        container: [...],
        disabled: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
      secondary: {
        container: [...],
        disabled: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
    },
  },
  modal: {
    variants: {
      default: {
        container: [...],
        header: {
          container: [...],
          title: [...],
          button: [...],
        },
        content: [...],
        footer: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
