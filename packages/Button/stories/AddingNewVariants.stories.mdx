# Adding a New Component Variant

Developers can add variants to a custom theme or extend the preset theme provided by Blaze.

You can group components as a whole stack, e.g. a Modal is composed of a Header, Content, and Footer sections. A modal footer contains actions, usually displayed as buttons.

We strongly suggest following React Composition principles as you would usually do while developing a custom component.

Following is an example of a custom theme,

```js

export const customTheme: ThemeType = {
  button: {
    variants: {
      default: {
        container: [...],
        disabled: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
      secondary: {
        container: [...],
        disabled: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
    },
  },
  modal: {
    variants: {
      default: {
        container: [...],
        header: {
          container: [...],
          title: [...],
          button: [...],
        },
        content: [...],
        footer: {
          container: [...],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
